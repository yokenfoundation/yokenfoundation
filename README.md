Welcome to Yoken (**$YO**)!

## Overview

Yoken (**$YO**) is a decentralized cryptocurrency project built on the TON blockchain primarily for fun — but who knows where it might lead?

## Mining

To start mining Yoken ($YO), follow these simple steps:

1. Send a transaction to the **[contract's address](#get-started)** with a 'yo' message in the comment.
2. Ensure to attach **0.3 $TON** to your transaction to activate the mining.

> Optionally, you can include your friend in the mining process by tagging their address in the transaction comment using the format 'yo&nbsp;{friend_address}', and they will receive **1 $YO** as well in case of your success!

> Do not send less than 0.3 $TON; otherwise, the transaction will be rejected.

### Early Birds

- The first **1,000** participants will receive **10,000 $YO** each
- The subsequent **10,000** participants will be rewarded with **1,000 $YO** each
- Following that, the next **100,000** participants will receive **100 $YO** each
- And for the remaining early miners, the next **1,000,000** participants will receive **10 $YO** each

### Rest

- 1% chance to receive **10 $YO**
- 10% chance to receive **$1 $YO**
- 89% chance to receive **0.1 $YO**

> To increase your chance of getting more **$YO** after early mining finishes, send $TON in the range **0.3 - 100**.

## Rules

- An account cannot mine twice consecutively.
- After a successful mining attempt, a random timeout is set for the next acceptable message, aligning with the time it takes to form a new block on the TON blockchain (about ~4 sec).
- The first account to send a “yo” or “yo {friend_address}” command after the timeout has ended will claim the mining reward.

## Penalties for Spamming

The contract can detect if a wallet (especcisaly highload wallets) sends more than one inbound message per one transaction or if you sending message too often (less than every ~4 seconds). If it does, the contract will retain the incoming funds without return. Please, no cheating!

## Distribution

Here's a breakdown of the token distribution:

- **Total Supply:** 99,000,000.00 $YO
- **Mineable Supply:** 93,000,000.00 $YO
- **Reserved Tokens:** 6,000,000 $YO for future events, team, liquidity pulls, etc.
