Welcome to Yoken (**$YO**)!

## Overview

Yoken (**$YO**) is a decentralized cryptocurrency project built on the TON blockchain primarily for fun. But who knows where it might lead?

## Mining

To start mining Yoken ($YO), follow these simple steps:

1. Send a transaction to the contract's address or to "**yoken.ton**" with a 'yo' message in the comment
2. Ensure to attach a minimum of 0.42 $TON to your transaction to activate the mining

> Optionally, you can include your friend in the mining process by tagging their address in the transaction comment using the format 'yo&nbsp;{friend_address}', and they will receive **1 $YO** as well!

> Do not send less than 0.42 $TON; otherwise, the transaction will be rejected.
